This report demonstrates various features of Microsoft Power BI, with a primary focus on the `Gauge Control`. The `Gauge` Control dynamically alters its color in response to value changes over time, specifically on a weekly basis. This report can be used as a template for those interested in displaying data with weekly updates. Additionally, it highlights the `Spaces between categories` feature within a stacked chart, providing a clear and organized visual representation of data.
